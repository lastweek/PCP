BUILD
	make oldconfig

RUN
	We are using a virtual machine in our lab's server.
	It is a quite large QEMU image that we are not able to submit.
	Please send <shan13@purdue.edu> an email before you want to test,
	so I can start the virtual machine for you.

	After I started the virtual machine, you can login via:
		$ ssh -l root -p 3131 wuklab14.ecn.purdue.edu
		$ cd ~
		$ cd work/
	
	Sorry for the inconvenience!

TEST
	There is a simple test program test.c in top directory. It will change
	the scheduling class from CFS to MYCFS. And then it will call
	sched_setlimit which is the new system call for part B.

	At last, it will fork a child process to demonstrate that a child task
	can inherit the scheduling class from parent.

DEBUGGING
	Use following cmd to catch runtime info:
	$ cat /proc/sched_debug

	To enable printk information inside mycfs, please add "mycfs_debug" to
	your kernel command line. You can add this by modifying grub.cfg
