		Four different computing models under different usages of edge devices.
		Type 1 means mobile device uses one edge device only. Edge device
		can also push computation to cloud in type 2. In type 3, edge devices
		can do load-balancing. Type 4 is the original two-tier architecture,
		mobile contact with cloud only.
