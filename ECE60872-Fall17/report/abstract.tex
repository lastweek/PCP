As the usage of mobile devices increases, the user requirements of applications grow as well.
Edge computing brings the computation closer to mobile devices, thus improves the performance
compared with normal cloud-based architecture. However, de-centralized edge devices also
introduced many reliability issues. It is still not clear how those intrisinc properties of edge
devices can effect system design and performance. In this paper, we present a detailed evaluation
of different edge device failure scenarios and our solutions to maintain good performance.
