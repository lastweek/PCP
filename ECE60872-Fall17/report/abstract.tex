As the usage of mobile devices increases, the user requirements of applications grow as well.
Edge computing brings the computation closer to mobile devices, thus improves the performance
compared with normal cloud-based architecture. However, decentralized edge devices also
introduced many reliability issues. It is still not clear how those intrisinc properties of edge
devices can effect system design and performance.

In this work, we first present a detailed simulation evaluation using a recent edge computing simulator.
The simulation result suggests that the performance gain of edge computing largely depends on
the computing model deployed. We proposed the idea of resilient edge computing, along with
several runtime policies and mechanisms to achieve this goal. To have a better understanding
of resilient edge computing, we further implemented and evaluated a set of in-house systems.
