As the usage of mobile devices increases, the user requirements of applications grow as well.
Edge computing brings the computation closer to mobile devices, thus improves the performance
compared with normal cloud-based architecture. However, decentralized edge devices also
introduced many reliability issues. It is still not clear how those intrisinc properties of edge
devices can affect system design and performance.

In this work, we first present a detailed simulation evaluation using a recent edge computing simulator.
The simulation result suggests that the performance gain of edge computing largely depends on
the computing model deployed. We propose the idea of resilient edge computing, which provides
high availability and reliability gurantees in addition to the better performance compared
with traditional two-tier architecture.
We further propose several efficient runtime policies and mechanisms to achieve this goal.
To illustrate the benefits of resilient edge computing, we bulid an application-specific runtime on edge device and
its corresponding mobile application and cloud server runtime. Our evaluation of this set of systems
confirms our finding from simulation, it also shows resilient edge computing is able to maintain
high performance in case of failures.
