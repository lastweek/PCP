\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we investigated edge computing under various settings
with both simulation and in-house application. Edge computing offers
the best performance with type 3 computing model. We investigated the
possibility of implementing application-specific edge device runtime,
and evaluate with different computing models.

Edge computing is an emerging area. Its decentralized approach resembles
the rise of personal computing in 1980s. There are still lots of possibilities
in this area, and we hope to have more exciting findings in the future.
