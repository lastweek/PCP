\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we investigated edge computing under various settings
with both simulation and in-house implemented application.
Edge computing offers the best performance with type 3 computing model,
where cloud and multiple edge devices are deployed.
We also propose the idea of resilient edge computing, which provides high
availability and reliability guarantees in addition to the better performance
compared with traditional two-tier architecture. We propose a simple but
effective load-balancing algorithm among edge devices.
To demonstrate the idea of resilient edge computing, we further build an application-specific
edge device runtime, and its corresponding mobile application. Our evaluation of this system
also comfirms our finding in simulation.

We still have some unsolved engineering work in our implemented system. Our testbed
setup also poses several limitations in our evaluation. We have identified them in
section~\ref{sec:result-analysis}, we leave these for future work.
