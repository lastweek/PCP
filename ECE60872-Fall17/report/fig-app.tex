		T1-T4 are performance without failure injected. Failure is injected 30 seconds
		after images have been uploaded. T2-F1 is the case where
		edge device failed during computation. T3-F1 is the case where the edge
		device received the uploaded images failed during computation. T3-F2 is
		the case where peer edge device failed. Application always re-send failed
		images to cloud.
